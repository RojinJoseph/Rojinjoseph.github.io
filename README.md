### PROJECTS

## 1. Netflix Recommendation:
- Developed a movie recommendation engine to provide personalized movie suggestions to users.
- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get useful insights.
- Applied Singular Value Decomposition to generate a user-movie similarity matrix and predict movie ratings.

## 2. Walmart Sales Prediction:
- Project focussed on forecasting Walmart sales for the next 12 weeks.
- Performed EDA and found useful insights like factors affecting weekly sales, any seasonal trends and performance of Walmart stores.
- Used Predictive time series model, ARIMA, to get accurate and timely sales predictions.

## 3. Census Income:
- Developed a comprehensive census project using data analytics to analyse population demographics, trends and patterns.
- Utilized census data to derive insights into population distribution, age groups, income levels and other socio-economic factors.

## 4. HR Analytics:
- Implemented HR analytics to gain insights into employee performance, retention and recruitment.
- Utilized data analytics techniques to analyse HR data, such as employee demographics, performance metrics and engagement surveys.
- The goal is to optimize HR processes, enhance employee satisfaction and make data driven decisions in workforce management.

## 5. Customer Churn:
- Developed a deep learning model using keras to predict customer churn, thereby stopping the customers from moving out from the service of the company.
- Analysed the data and found insights of customers satisfaction level, Payment Methods and monthly charges.

## 6. Credit Score Detection:
- Utilized credit data of various customers in the bank to analyse the data and to get useful insights.
- Developed a Random Forest model to predict the credit score of a new customer.

## 7. Revenue Prediction:
- After analysing the data developed a linear regression model to predict the revenue of the restaurant.

## 9. Insurance Charge Prediction:
- Analysed the historical data of customers in an organization and the respective charges levied upon the insurance company by them.
- Developed a linear regression model to predict the insurance charges to be paid for a new set of data.

## 10. Bank loan prediction:
- Utilized the loan data of a bank having details of customer and the loan provided to analyse and to get useful insights.
- Developed a logistic regression model to predict whether to a give insurance or not to a person with new set of data.

## 11.Heart Disease:
- Project focussed on predicting whether the person has heart disease or not if new set of patient data is given.
- Analysed patients’ data to find insights like factors leading to heart disease, patient’s demographics.
- Developed Decision Tree Classifier model for prediction and performed hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
